  <p>
  Fight your way through an unforgiving arena, learning how to use Newtonian movement to give yourself an edge over your enemies.
  Upgrade your ship and your weapons along the way with random stacking upgrades, but don't take too long, as the enemy will soon overwhelm you.
  </p>
  <p>
  Debris Field is under active development, and will continue to be updated with new content and mechanics over time. By purchasing now, you are
