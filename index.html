<h1>Bio</h1>

<img class="profile-image" src="images/profile.jpg">

<p>
    My name is Pearce Michal, and I am a software developer and artist with a wide and varied skillset that I have cultivated over a lifetime of self driven curiosity.
    These skills include game design, web development, photography, and MIDI composition, just to name a few.
</p>
    I love to experiment with the technical and artistic capabilities of computers, and I am always seeking new tools and techniques to add to my
    ever growing arsenal of creative productivity.
<p>

</p>

<p>
    I have spent a great deal of time working on various projects, such as contributing to open source software, participating in game development community events,
    and even creating and publishing my own video games through my game studio, Binary Nomad Games. Above all else, I enjoy the process of creation, and all of the frustration
    and exultation that comes with it.

<h2>Web Design Philosophy</h2>
<hr>
<p>When it comes to web design, I believe in elegant simplicity. I do like to experiment with different styles, but the primary focus should always be on
function over form. and properly directiong users towards the information that is important to them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Game Design Philosophy</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Games are a unique plateform for expression, because you have the freedom to not only create a new world outside the laws of reality, but allow players to experience it
    and interact with it in rediculus, amazing ways. I've always been a firm believer in using games as a plateform for experimentation, both in concept and experience.
    My main goal as a game developer is to always try new things, and ultimately make games that I feel compliment their intended genre.
