<h1>About</h1>
<hr>

<img class="profile-image" src="images/profile.jpg">

<p>
    My name is Pearce Michal, and I am a software developer and artist with a wide and varied skillset that I have cultivated over a lifetime of self driven curiosity.
    These skills include game design, web development, photography, and MIDI composition, just to name a few.
</p>
    I love to experiment with the technical and artistic capabilities of computers, and I am always seeking new tools and techniques to add to my
    ever growing arsenal of creative productivity.
<p>

</p>

<p>
    I have spent a great deal of time working on various projects, such as contributing to open source software, participating in game development community events,
    and even creating and publishing my own video games through my game studio, Binary Nomad Games. Above all else, I enjoy the process of creation, and all of the frustration
    and exultation that comes with it.
</p>

<p>
You can follow me on Twitter to get updates about what I'm working on, and I also post devlogs to my Itch.IO page, and upload gameplay videos to Youtube.
